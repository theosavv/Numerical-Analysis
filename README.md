# Project Overview üîé
Prompted by the university class of Numerical Analysis, in this project many well known complex numerical methods had to be created from scrach using MATLAB.
[Here](https://github.com/theosavv/Numerical-Analysis/blob/main/Numerical-Analysis/First_Mandatory_Assignment_Numerical_Analysis.pdf)  the extensive presentation of the project can be found.
# What I learned üí°
Except for learing to use tools like MATLAB and Octave as well as LateX documentation tool (in which the presentation was created), I gained good insight on many useful Numerical Methods like Bisection, Cholesky decomposision, Gauss-Seidel, LU decomposision, Newton-Raphson, Secant, and last but not least **the foundamentals of the PageRank algorithm** (the numerical background of the algorithm), which was the last subtask of the project.
Another important insight during this project, was on the process of experimentation (because the instructor of the class required experimentation results and quality conclusions of the methods implemented) as well as documenting results.
# Technical info ‚öôÔ∏è
All of the methods are implemented in MATLAB. There is also a `main` method that includes LateX source code.
